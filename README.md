# Workflow
* Learning Badge- Demitri is teaxching a class. Demitri makes an activity and includes HTML on th epage allowing webmentions to be recieved by the third party ledger.

Maha completes the learning activity from her own blog. She then creates a new post as a [reply](https://indieweb.org/reply)  to the learning activity with a link to their post with evidence. They may include an optional description of how their evidence meets the criteria discussed inthe learning activity.

Demetri then sends back a "badg" which is a post containing a u-photo of the badge image and list the criteria Maha met. 

The webmention badge is then saved in the ledger as both applies and recieved.

* Attendance Badge-Christina is hosting a conference. She posts an h-event where people can both rsvp and check into a venue.

Tiara then posts a checkin that she is at the conference venue with a link back to the venue.

Christina sends Tiara a webmention badge as a reply to her checkin noting here conference attendance.

Tiara adds the badge to her conference page. The badge image links back to the post Christina sent awarding the badge.
